# Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis
The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV:
* meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)
* sd: standard deviation of frequency
* median: median frequency (in kHz)
* Q25: first quantile (in kHz)
* Q75: third quantile (in kHz)
* IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)
* skew: skewness
* kurt: kurtosis
* sp.ent: spectral entropy
* sfm: spectral flatness
* mode: mode frequency
* centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)
* peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)
* meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
* minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
* maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
* meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
* modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range
* label: male or female
